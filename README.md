## Purpose

I created this web site for my client who work as a hairdresser

## Development method

My client wanted to have a blog feature on their website, so I decided to build it using WordPress. Before integrating the code into WordPress, I developed it with Gulp to make it more efficient. I compressed images automatically and reduced coding times by using Pug and SCSS.


## What I struggled

I struggled to improve the page load speed. I used many methods to achieve this, such as implementing lazy-loading and compressing images.
